The forest is a dangerous place to wander alone, but you are alone.
Your adventure did not start this way. Having got lost in the woods, one by one
your party has set off alone to bring back help. Late is the hour and it feels as if you are watched by all sides
the only source of comfort comes from the fire, and the peculiar owl who has been watching your meal for sometime now.
