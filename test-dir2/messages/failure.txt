You didn't know what to expect when you went running into the cave. You thought at last you would see Tomas and Marie again.
The sound of movement echos off of the cavewalls, the air is musty and thick.
Expecting a fond reunion you smile brightly as you rush ahead and begin calling out into the cave, but you do not hear reply.
A sharp pain shoots through you and everything fades to black. You have died.
