To Make Game Work:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tale/

Follow instructions at above website


To Launch Game:
cd into the /tale/ directory

For me this was Python3/lib/site-packages/tale

From Bash:
python3 -m tale.main -g Python3/Lib/site-packages/tale/test-dir2 --web

^^^^ Make sure to put test-dir2 in that exact format on your file system ^^^^^
